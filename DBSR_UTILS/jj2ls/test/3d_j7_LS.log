name of case:   3d_j7

3d_j7.c contains:

number of atomic states   =     5
number of configurations  =     4
number of ang. symmetries =     5

corresponding LS values:

number of configurations  =     4
number of ang. symmetries =     5

get_tr_coef provide:

total number of transition coefficients =       25
non-zero transition coefficients =       23    92.0 %

get_LS_conf provide:

number of LS atomic states   =     5
